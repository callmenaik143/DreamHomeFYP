# DreamHomeFYP
In the evolving field of architectural design, the integration of advanced machine learning techniques offers unprecedented opportunities for innovation and efficiency. We developed an online web application, DreamHome, that harnesses the capabilities of sophisticated algorithms to generate customized floor plans based on user-defined parameters. Utilizing the Hugging Face platform and Streamlit for the frontend, our application leverages Stable Diffusion v1.4, a state-of-the-art diffusion model, to produce detailed and accurate floor layouts.
The employed dataset comprises various attributes, including indices, string lengths, image widths, walls, colours, and footprints, enabling the model to create comprehensive and visually appealing designs. The backend, implemented in Python, integrates libraries such as datasets for data management, PIL for image processing, and NumPy for numerical computations. Additionally, Flask is utilized to provide a robust API, facilitating seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.
The development process encompassed data preparation, model training, and interface creation, supported by an extensive dataset of 12,000 floor plans standardized to a 512x512 resolution. Training was executed on an **NVIDIA A100 GPU**, incorporating techniques like gradient accumulation, gradient checkpointing, and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for enhanced stability, achieving a step loss of 0.188 over 2000 steps.
Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the system's effectiveness, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the architectural design process by significantly improving efficiency and creativity. Future enhancements include expanding the dataset, refining the model, and adding more design features. DreamHome exemplifies a substantial advancement in the application of machine learning to architectural design, providing a powerful tool for professionals in the field.
